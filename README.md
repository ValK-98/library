# The Odin Project - Book Library


Still in development. 

After my calculator project I've learned a valuable skill when it comes to approaching projects - planning ahead and taking little steps. 
This made this project considerably easier. Instead of winging it, I took a calculated approach how I will tackle each individual function. 
This was great as I made a couple of relatively simple functions and then chained them together, rather than attempting to wing who knows what. 

I still have to add better interactivity and change the scaling of the book cards. But unfortunately I am out of time today so I'll continue this on Sunday!
