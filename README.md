# The Odin Project - Book Library


After my calculator project I've learned a valuable skill when it comes to approaching projects - planning ahead and taking little steps. 
This made this project considerably easier. Instead of winging it, I took a calculated approach how I will tackle each individual function. 
This was great as I made a couple of relatively simple functions and then chained them together, rather than attempting to wing who knows what. 

 
At this point in time the library is almost fully functional. I do have an outstanding bug where if you delete book cards the data-index element doesn't match the myLibrary array. Thus leaving elements in array and breaking functions. Need to fix for full functionality.
